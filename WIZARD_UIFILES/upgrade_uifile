TeamSpeak is entitled to change the licence fees within the framework<br>    of a further development of the software solutions or due to the adjustment<br>    to the market situation.<br>    9.4. In the event of a price adjustment a list with the changed prices will<br>    be sent to the customer in a text form.<br>    9.5. The customer has the possibility to terminate the licence agreement<br>    extraordinarily without notice within a deadline of four weeks beginning<br>    with the receipt of the notification described in Subclause 9.4 of these<br>    General Business Terms.<br>    9.6. The customer has the possibility to object to the price adjustment<br>    within a deadline of four weeks beginning with the receipt of the<br>    notification described in Subclause 9.4 of these General Business Terms. In<br>    the event of an objection of the customer TeamSpeak is entitled to<br>    terminate the contract extraordinarily within a deadline of four weeks<br>    beginning with the receipt of the objection by TeamSpeak.<br><br>10. Price details and terms of payment concerning the licensing of the software<br>solutions<br><br>    10.1. All prices or price details stated by TeamSpeak shall always concern,<br>    even if an explicit currency detail is missing, US Dollar, insofar as not<br>    agreed otherwise between the parties.<br>    10.2. All prices or price details shall be deemed plus the respective<br>    applicable value added tax as well as public duties, which possibly<br>    continue to be due.<br>    10.3. Only the payment possibilities displayed under the menu item \"Pay\"<br>    are open to the customer with orders via TeamSpeak.com, whereby TeamSpeak<br>    explicitly reserves the right to refuse a payment method selected by the<br>    customer in the contractual offer.<br>    10.4. In case of orders by telephone or orders sent by e-mail, fax or post<br>    the payment by bank transfer is agreed as payment in advance subject to a<br>    deviating agreement, whereby the remuneration of TeamSpeak will be due and<br>    payable upon conclusion of the contract, i.e. that the customer is obliged<br>    to pay the remuneration in advance.<br>    10.5. In the event of the agreement of a payment by invoice the payment<br>    will be due and payable within fourteen days from the time when the invoice<br>    is received by the customer.<br>    10.6. TeamSpeak is entitled to only carry out or provide still outstanding<br>    services against advance payment or provision of security if it becomes<br>    aware of circumstances after conclusion of the contract, which are suitable<br>    for substantially reducing the creditworthiness of the customer and through<br>    which the payment of the outstanding receivables of TeamSpeak by the<br>    customer from the respective contractual relationship (including from other<br>    individual orders) is jeopardised.<br><br>11. Termination of the contracts concerning the licensing of the software<br>solutions<br><br>    11.1. The contracts have the contractual term stated in the service<br>    specifications (hereinafter referred to as \"minimum contractual term\"),<br>    i.e.<br>        11.1.1 The contract concerning the licence model \"Unlicensed\" has no<br>        fixed contractual term. The licence model can be used by the customer<br>        at all times as long as TeamSpeak offers this licence model.<br>        11.1.2 The contract concerning the licence model \"NPL\" has a minimum<br>        contractual term of six months.<br>        11.1.3 The contract concerning the licence model \"AAL\" has a minimum<br>        contractual term of twelve months.<br>        11.1.4 The contract concerning the licence model \"ATHP\" has a minimum<br>        contractual term of twelve months.<br>        11.1.5 The contract concerning the licence model \"SDK\" has the<br>        individually agreed minimum contractual term.<br>    11.2. The licence agreement can be terminated by the customer at all times<br>    as of the end of the minimum contract term without adhering to a period of<br>    notice. TeamSpeak can terminate the licence agreement at all times by<br>    adhering to a period of notice in the amount of half the period of the<br>    minimum contractual term as of the end of the minimum contractual term.<br>    11.3. The contract will be extended automatically by the minimum<br>    contractual term if none of the parties terminates the contract as of the<br>    end of the minimum contractual term. With the licence model \"NPL\" the<br>    contract will only be extended automatically if the customer has used the<br>    software solution within a period of one month before termination of the<br>    minimum contractual term; otherwise the contract will end automatically<br>    with the termination of the minimum contractual term.<br>    11.4. The right of both parties to the extraordinary termination shall<br>    remain unaffected. <br>    11.5. An extraordinary right of termination for TeamSpeak shall in<br>    particular exist,<br>        11.5.1 if the customer is in default with two consecutive invoices<br>        regarding the licence payment.<br>        11.5.2 if the customer repeatedly falls short of the minimum licence<br>        fee with a contract concerning the licence model \"ATHP\".<br>        11.5.3 if, despite a warning, the customer repeatedly breaches its<br>        obligations from the licence agreement, including these General<br>        Business Terms, and the breaches are not insignificant.<br>        11.5.4 if the customer, despite a warning by TeamSpeak, repeatedly<br>        breaches its main obligation under this contract and is responsible for<br>        the breach.<br>        11.5.5 if the customer has selected the licence models \"Unlicensed\" or<br>        \"NPL\" without having the capacity as a consumer or non-commercial<br>        grouping or this capacity has subsequently ceased to exist. In this<br>        case the right is reserved to assert damages.<br>    11.6. Each termination requires a text form.<br><br>12. Obligations of the customer concerning the use of the client<br><br>    12.1. The customer has the obligation and responsibility to make use of<br>    data backups at sufficient intervals. TeamSpeak assumes no responsibility<br>    for any loss of data resulting from a breach of this obligation. This does<br>    not apply if TeamSpeak is responsible for the breach.<br>    12.2. The customer shall make use of virus protection following the latest<br>    technical standards.<br>    12.3. Standard software upgrades are free of charge, if and when they<br>    become available. The customer has the responsibility to install client<br>    upgrades promptly after publication. Otherwise the usability of the client<br>    may be restricted.<br><br>13. Termination of the contracts concerning the client<br><br>    13.1. The customer is entitled to terminate this agreement at any time by<br>    removal of the client from all devices. <br>    13.2. The mutual right for premature extraordinary termination (also<br>    without previous notice) remains unaffected<br>    13.3. Any termination requires the immediate removal of the client.<br><br>14. Publication of contributions in the forum<br><br>    14.1. The registered customer has the possibility to publish contributions<br>    via the customer area of its customer account in the \"Forum\" zone on<br>    TeamSpeak.com.<br>    14.2. For the purpose of publishing a new contribution the customer will<br>    upload the contribution by pressing the \"Post New Thread\" button . When<br>    replying to the contribution of another customer the customer will press<br>    the button with the inscription \"Reply To Thread\" in order to publish its<br>    reply contribution. The contribution will be transmitted to TeamSpeak<br>    hereby and published by TeamSpeak on TeamSpeak.com.<br>    14.3. TeamSpeak does not check the contributions before publication. In the<br>    event of a reference to the unlawful nature of a contribution TeamSpeak<br>    explicitly reserves the right to delete individual contributions.<br>    14.4. The customer undertakes towards TeamSpeak not to publish any<br>    contributions, which violate the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany or<br>    infringe the rights of third parties.<br>    14.5. The customer shall indemnify TeamSpeak from all rights of third<br>    parties, which these assert against TeamSpeak owing to the publication of<br>    contributions on TeamSpeak.com by the customer. Subject to the approval of<br>    the customer TeamSpeak will not submit any acknowledgements or other<br>    legally relevant declarations, which substantiate the asserted claims of<br>    the third party.<br>    14.6. The indemnification obligation described in Subclause 14.5 of these<br>    General Business Terms shall cease to apply if the circumstances which<br>    substantiate the claims of the third party are verifiably due to a grossly<br>    negligent or wilful misconduct of TeamSpeak.<br>    14.7. TeamSpeak undertakes to inform the customer immediately of the filing<br>    of actions against it or the assertion of claims and to give it the<br>    possibility to take over the legal defence.<br><br>15. Termination of the user account for the forum<br><br>    15.1. The customer has the possibility to have its customer account deleted<br>    by TeamSpeak at all times. For this purpose the customer will send the<br>    deletion request to TeamSpeak in a text form. A termination is also<br>    possible towards a moderator of the forum in a text form. TeamSpeak will<br>    delete the customer's forum account immediately after receipt of the<br>    termination. Contributions published by the customer can be deleted or<br>    anonymised at the discretion of TeamSpeak. The contract concerning the use<br>    of the customer account will end with the deletion.<br>    15.2. TeamSpeak is entitled to terminate the contract concerning the use of<br>    the customer account at all times by adhering to a period of notice of<br>    three months to the end of the quarter of a calendar year.<br>    15.3. The right to the extraordinary termination of both parties shall<br>    remain unaffected. A right to the extraordinary termination shall in<br>    particular exist if the customer, despite a warning, repeatedly breaches<br>    its obligations from Subclause 14.4 of these General Business Terms and the<br>    breach is not insignificant.<br>    15.4. Each termination shall require a text form.<br><br>16. Publication of Add-ons<br><br>    16.1. If the customer is registered as a Developer it has the possibility<br>    to upload Add-ons and therefore offer these to third parties for download<br>    free of charge<br>    16.2. In order to upload Add-Ons the customer will press the button with<br>    the inscription \"Upload Add-ons\" in the customer area of its customer<br>    account.<br>    The customer will transmit the Add-ons uploaded to it by pressing the<br>    button with the inscription \"Add Addon\" to TeamSpeak.<br>    16.3. TeamSpeak publishes the Add-ons on \"MyTeamSpeak\".<br>    16.4. TeamSpeak does not check the uploaded Add-ons before publication. In<br>    the event of a reference to the unlawful nature of an Add-On TeamSpeak<br>    explicitly reserves the right to delete individual contributions.<br>    16.5. The customer undertakes towards TeamSpeak not to publish any Add-ons,<br>    which violate the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany or infringe the<br>    rights of third parties.<br>    16.6. The customer shall indemnify TeamSpeak from all rights of third<br>    parties, which these assert against TeamSpeak owing to the publication of<br>    Add-ons on TeamSpeak.com by the customer. Subject to the approval of the<br>    customer TeamSpeak will not submit any acknowledgements or other legally<br>    relevant declarations, which substantiate the asserted claims of the third<br>    party.<br>    16.7. The indemnification obligation described in Subclause 16.6 of these<br>    General Business Terms shall cease to apply if the circumstances which<br>    substantiate the claims of the third party are verifiably due to a grossly<br>    negligent or wilful misconduct of TeamSpeak.<br>    16.8. TeamSpeak undertakes to inform the customer immediately of the filing<br>    of actions against it or the assertion of claims and to give it the<br>    possibility to take over the legal defence.<br><br>17. Termination of the customer account as a Developer<br><br>    17.1. The customer has the possibility to have its customer account as<br>    Developer deleted by TeamSpeak at all times. For this purpose the customer<br>    will send the deletion request to TeamSpeak in a text form. TeamSpeak will<br>    delete the customer's Developer account immediately after receipt of the<br>    termination. Add-ons published by the customer will also be deleted<br>    immediately. With the deletion the contract will end concerning the use of<br>    the Developer account.<br>    17.2. TeamSpeak is entitled to terminate the contract concerning the use of<br>    the Developer account at all times by adhering to a period of notice of<br>    three months to the end of the quarter of a calendar year.<br>    17.3. The right to the extraordinary termination of both parties shall<br>    remain unaffected. A right to the extraordinary termination shall in<br>    particular exist if the customer, despite a warning, repeatedly breaches<br>    its obligations from Subclause 16.5 of these General Business Terms and the<br>    breach is not insignificant.<br>    17.4. Each termination shall require a text form.<br><br> <br><br>C. General terms<br><br>18. Warranty<br><br>    18.1. The statutory warranty rights shall apply to consumers.<br>    18.2. The following provisions will apply towards entrepreneurs:<br>        18.2.1 The warranty rights of the customer shall become statute-barred<br>        within one year. This shall not apply to culpably caused damages that<br>        can be attributed to TeamSpeak from the injury to life, the body or the<br>        health and damages caused by gross negligence or wilful intent or<br>        fraudulent intent as well as with claims for recourse according to<br>        Sections 478, 479 BGB.<br>        18.2.2 A warranty on the part of TeamSpeak is excluded insofar as the<br>        defect was suffered due to circumstances, which TeamSpeak caused at the<br>        explicit request of the customer.<br>        18.2.3 The liability for damages, irrespective of fault, for initial<br>        defects according to Section 536a Par. 1 BGB is excluded.<br><br>19. Liability<br><br>    19.1. TeamSpeak shall be liable in all cases of contractual and<br>    non-contractual liability in case of wilful intent and gross negligence<br>    according to the statutory provisions.<br>    19.2. In other cases TeamSpeak shall only be liable - insofar as not<br>    otherwise regulated in Subclause 19.3 of these General Business Terms -<br>    with a breach of a contractual obligation, the fulfilment of which makes<br>    the proper execution of the contract possible at all and on the compliance<br>    with which the customer may therefore, as a rule, rely upon (so-called<br>    cardinal obligation). The liability of TeamSpeak is excluded in all other<br>    cases, subject to the regulation in Subclause 19.3 of these General<br>    Business Terms.<br>    19.3. Insofar as TeamSpeak is fundamentally liable according to Subclause<br>    19.1 of these General Business Terms, this liability is limited to damages,<br>    which TeamSpeak foresaw as a possible consequence of a breach of contract<br>    upon conclusion of the contract or should have foreseen when applying the<br>    customary care and attention. Indirect damages and follow-up damages, which<br>    are the consequence of defects to the service by TeamSpeak, are in addition<br>    only capable of compensation insofar as such damages can typically be<br>    expected with the use of the service as intended.<br>    19.4. The liability of TeamSpeak for damages from the injury to life, the<br>    body or the health and according to the German Product Liability Act shall<br>    remain unaffected by the aforementioned liability limitations and<br>    exclusions.<br><br>20. Offsetting, rights of retention and assignment<br><br>    20.1. The customer is only entitled to offset against claims against<br>    TeamSpeak, which have been declared final and binding or are undisputed.<br>    The same shall apply to the assertion of rights of retention.<br>    20.2. The assignment of claims against TeamSpeak to third parties is only<br>    possible with the written consent of TeamSpeak. This shall in particular<br>    also apply to an assignment of the licence granted by TeamSpeak to third<br>    parties.<br><br>21. Text form<br><br>    21.1. Addendums and amendments to the reached agreements between TeamSpeak<br>    and the customer including these General Business Terms shall require a<br>    text form in order to be valid.<br>    21.2. With the exception of managing directors or authorized signatories<br>    the employees of TeamSpeak are not entitled to reach oral agreements, which<br>    deviate from these regulations.<br><br>22. Applicable law and place of jurisdiction<br><br>    22.1. German law will apply. With consumers this choice of law will only<br>    apply insofar as the protection granted by mandatory provisions of the law<br>    of the state of the consumer's customary place of above is not withdrawn<br>    hereby (principle of favourability).<br>    22.2. The place of performance for all services from the business<br>    relationships existing with TeamSpeak as well as the place of jurisdiction<br>    is the registered seat of TeamSpeak, insofar as the user is not a consumer,<br>    but a merchant, legal entity under public law or special fund under public<br>    law. The same shall apply if the user does not have a general place of<br>    jurisdiction in Germany or the EU or the place of residence or customary<br>    place of abode is not known at the time when the action is filed. The<br>    authorization to also bring the matter before the court at another<br>    statutory place of jurisdiction, shall remain unaffected hereby.<br>    22.3. The provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the<br>    International Sale of Goods will explicitly not apply.<br><br> <br><br>II. Customer information<br><br>1.
